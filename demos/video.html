        <p>The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is converted from an inline to a block-level control, so this span of text should be rendered below the video not alongside it. Video containers are also made to never exceed the width of their container. However, while the video itself will scale proportionally, the height of the video box will remain consistent, resulting in a letterbox effect. So, we give video containers a black background so that the letterbox effect doesn't look so bad.</p>

# Compatibility


## Web Browsers

Elementary CSS supports a wide range of browsers for both desktop and mobile. The current version has been comprehensively tested in the following browsers. (The figures in brackets are [global market share as of July 2017](http://gs.statcounter.com/)).

- Android 4.4 (1%)
- Chrome 58-60 for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu (22%)
- Chrome 60 for Android (30%)
- Edge 40 (1%)
- Firefox 54 for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu (3.75%)
- Internet Explorer 11 (3%)
- Opera 47 (1%)
- Opera Mini 28 for Android (~3%)
- Safari 10.1 for macOS (1.3%)
- Safari 10.2 (1.5%) and 10.3 (8%) for iOS 
- Samsung Internet for Android 4 (3.8%)
- UC Browser for Android 11.4 (9.1%)

Once a browser release dips below 1% global market share _in the browser's category_, the minimum supported version is bumped. Note that category share is higher than total market share. For example, Microsoft Edge has about a 1% total market share, but more than 3% in the desktop category and higher still among Windows users.

The list of supported browsers is reviewed annually or with major releases, whichever comes sooner.


## Web Standards

Elementary CSS is compatible with modern web standards. No effort is made to deal with HTML elements that have been deprecated from the HTML5 specification, things like ``<acronym>`` and ``<center>``. 

New HTML elements that have been recently added to the specification but which are not yet widely supported, things like ``<menu>``, are also omitted.

# Installation


1. Download or clone the [source code repository](https://github.com/kieranpotts/elementary).
2. Extract the contents of the ``./src/`` directory.
3. Incorporate the source files into your own project.
4. You will need a [Sass tool](https://sass-lang.com/) to transpile the source files to CSS. Alternatively, you can use the ready-made ``./dist/elementary.css`` or the minified version ``./dist/elementary.min.css``.

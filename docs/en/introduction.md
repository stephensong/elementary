# Introduction


Reset style sheets iron out inconsistencies in the default presentation given to HTML elements by web browsers.

Elementary CSS goes further. It overrides the browser's default style sheet to provide a leaner, more minimalist baseline from which to build modern web application interfaces.

The effect is that by default everything in an HTML document looks very samey. It is intentionally generic. For example, all text — from headings to small print — is rendered at the same size, and table cells are stripped of padding and borders.

It means that all aspects of an application's design is implemented via that application's own classes.

Elementary CSS is not intended to be used as is. You are encouraged to fork and modify Elementary CSS for your own needs. The source files are extensively commented to help you. You should change the default fonts and colors, and create your own set of base styles that are appropriate for your application's GUI.

An aggressive reset like this is a great starting point for enforcing your own opinions on your CSS architecture.
